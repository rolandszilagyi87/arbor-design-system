# Arbor Design System

A reusable design system built with SCSS.
Provides design tokens, components, and utility mixins for building consistent, scalable UI.

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install arbor-design
```

> ðŸ’¡ Make sure you also have `sass` installed:
> ```bash
> npm install --save-dev sass
> ```

---

## Usage

### Option 1 â€“ SCSS (recommended)

```scss
@use 'arbor-design/packages/tokens' as *;
@use 'arbor-design/packages/utilities' as *;
@use 'arbor-design/packages/base' as *;
@use 'arbor-design/packages/components' as *;

.container {
  background-color: $color-primary-500;
  @include elevation-sm;
}
```

Build it:

```bash
npx sass --load-path=node_modules src/styles/main.scss dist/main.css
```

Include the result in your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/main.css" />
```

---

### Option 2 â€“ CDN (prebuilt CSS)

If you only need the compiled CSS without SCSS customization:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/arbor-design-system@latest/dist/arbor-design.css" />

<button class="button-primary">Click me</button>
```
